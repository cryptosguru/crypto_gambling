faq.breadcrumb=Frequently asked questions
faq.title=Frequently asked questions
faq.question1=What is Instantri.ch? 
faq.question1text1=Instantri.ch is an on-line game site that uses Bitcoin as the only payment method.  Prizes are always in Bitcoins or credits to keep on playing. The prizes you win will depend on your luck and your ability.
faq.question1text2=At any time there will always be several games in progress. Each of those games will have a lot of boxes with the prize hidden in only one of those boxes. You have to open the right box to win that prize. 
faq.question1text3=You open a box with credits.  The number of credits to open a box increases as the game progresses. The less boxes that remain unopened, the more credits you need to open a box. Every time you open a box, the credits will be automatically taken from your account.   
faq.question1text4=If you open a box and you find the prize hidden in it you will win it if nobody opens a new box in a predetermined time. If somebody opens a new box within that amount of time, the prize will be hidden in one of the remaining unopened boxes and the game will continue.
faq.question2=How much does it cost to participate in Instantri.ch?  
faq.question2text1=There are several available games to choose. Decide how many credits you want to use.  To open one box has a price in credits that will be taken from your account. To add credits to your account, click on the option <strong>Buy credits</strong> where you can buy as many credits as you want. The only currency accepted is Bitcoin.
faq.question2text2=You need to register in Instantri.ch to play a game and to buy credits. Registration is free. Besides, if you validate your email account clicking in the link we send you, you'll bee able to play in our free games.			           
faq.question2text3=However there are several ways to participate in Instantri.ch spending nothing. You will discover that sometimes there are promotions that allow you to get free credits or recover those you have lost in a game you haven't won. There is also a game type in which opening a box costs nothing (users can only open one box in this game type). 			           
faq.question2text4=You can spend as much money as you want in Instantri.ch. You can win several prizes without spending a single <strong>Satoshi</strong> or you can be a strong player buying a high amount of credits and designing an elaborate gaming strategy.  			           
faq.question3=I've won a prize. Do I have to pay anything else? 
faq.question3text1=No. In Instantri.ch the only time you have to pay is when buying credits. Everything else is free. 
faq.question3text2=If you win a prize in Bitcoins, in credits or in both, you won't have to pay anything, we will send the prize automatically for free.  			           
faq.question4=I'm playing in a game but it isn't shown in the statistics.  
faq.question4text1=Don't worry. Your statistics are updated when games finish so there is data which won't be shown until those games end. 
faq.question5=What happens when nobody finds the prize in any box?
faq.question5text1=It depends on if somebody found the prize previously.			          	 
faq.question5text2=Where there are only two unopened boxes left, only one of them can be opened, existing 50% chances of finding the prize position. If the user who opens the box finds the prize, they will win the prize immediately. If they fail, two events may take place:
faq.question5text3=<strong>1-</strong>If there was an user who found the prize previously, they will win the prize.
faq.question5text4=<strong>2-</strong>If there was no user who found the prize previously, nobody gets the prize and all used credits will be refunded to every user who has played in that game.
faq.question6=Somebody has found the prize position, can I still open boxes?
faq.question6text1=Yes. When somebody finds the prize position he won't get it immediately (this rule won't apply if there was only two unopened boxes left). He has to wait a predetermined time which may vary between a few minutes and several hours. During this time any other user may open a new box. If this happens, the prize will be randomly repositioned in any of the boxes which remain unopened so this user can find the prize position again.          	 
faq.question6text2=If the time counter reaches 0 and nobody opened a new box, the user who found the position in the first place will keep it definitely.
faq.question7=How do I know you haven't change the prize position during the game?
faq.question7text1=Every game has a MD5 hash attached generated from a text string which includes the prize position. When a prize is found that text string will be shown so everybody can check if it matches the MD5 hash. You can see it by yourself in any game detail page.           	 
faq.question8=Is there any affiliation program?
faq.question8text1=Actually there are two affiliation programs.             	 
faq.question8text2=One is called <strong>Reward Program</strong>. It's available if you are a registered user in Instantri.ch. You'll get one credit for every other user who signs up and validates his email address using your username as code. You can give the url https://www.instantri.ch/register?affiliate=<strong>YourUserName</strong> to anyone you want. The maximun amount of credits you can get by this mean is <strong>5</strong>.
faq.question8text3=Other is called <strong>Affiliation Program</strong> and it's appropriate for you if you have a company, a blog o any page. You'll get 15% of every Bitcoin an user who signs up thanks to you spends in Instantri.ch. You need to contact us so we can create a new affiliation account for you. Go to <strong><a href="/affiliate">Affiliation/Reward Program</a></strong> to get more information.
faq.question9=Can I create multiple accounts and get free credits?
faq.question9text1=One of the main rules of the site is not to create fake accounts. Of course there is no easy way to avoid it so maybe you'll be able to create multiple fake accounts and use them to get free credits before we realize.
faq.question9text2=But don't forget that every prize we deliver is processed manually so we won't give a single Satoshi to an user with a suspicious behaviour. So go ahead, play around, have fun, but don't expect to win anything if you don't follow the rules.
